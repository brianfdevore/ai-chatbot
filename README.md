# AI CHATBOT
This program implements a Python-based AI chatbot.

## Instructions to run
1. Train the model by running the training.py module
```shell
python training.py
```
2. Run the chatbot by running the chatbot.py module
```shell
python chatbot.py
```
3. You can play around with adjusting the intents.json file parameters.  Patterns are not case-sensitive, and are later tokenized and lemmatized by the program.  You can add more patterns to help train the model better.  You can also add more intents to train the model better as well.
